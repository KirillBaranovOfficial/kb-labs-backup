title: Commit plugin — Long-running generation reports progress and can be cancelled
persona: solo-developer
area: plugins
priority: P1
status: active
release: true
modes: [local, secured]
surfaces: [cli]

## Goal

A developer runs the commit plugin's potentially long LLM generation, sees progress while it runs, and can interrupt it from the terminal.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] The `@kb-labs/commit` plugin is installed and enabled in the project.
- [ ] A Git repository has enough staged changes to keep generation running during observation, and its LLM adapter is configured.

## Steps

| # | Action | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| S-030.1 | Run `kb commit commit --dry-run` with the staged changes | The CLI displays an active progress indicator and a generation phase message before printing the plan. |
| S-030.2 | Observe output while generation is still in progress | At least one subsequent phase update is visible before the final result. |
| S-030.3 | Send Ctrl+C while the command is generating | The command exits in response to the interrupt, restores the terminal prompt, and does not print an uncaught worker `EPIPE` error. |
| S-030.4 | Inspect Git history after cancellation | No commit was created by the interrupted `--dry-run` command. |
