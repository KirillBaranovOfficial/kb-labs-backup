## Goal

When a workflow step fails, the user can identify the failed step, error, and relevant logs.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Project workflow containing a shell step that exits non-zero.

## Steps

| # | Action | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| S-029.1 | Run the failing workflow using `kb workflow run --workflow-id=<project>/fails` | CLI returns a run ID. |
| S-029.2 | Run `kb workflow runs view <runId>` after the step fails | The persisted run reaches `failed` without a daemon restart and names the failed step with its useful error message. |
| S-029.3 | Run `kb workflow runs logs <runId>` | Output shows the failing command’s diagnostic context without a raw service stack trace. |
