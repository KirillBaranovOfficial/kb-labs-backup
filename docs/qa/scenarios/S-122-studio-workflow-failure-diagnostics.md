title: Studio — Find diagnostics for a failed workflow run

## Goal

When a workflow fails or a runtime is unhealthy, use Studio to identify the affected project and run, then reach the relevant logs and health diagnostics without searching unrelated platform output.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Registered project with a workflow fixture that fails in a named step and emits a unique diagnostic marker.
- [ ] Gateway observability data contains the failed run and the matching log record; a second healthy project is registered.

## Steps

| # | Action | Expected |
|---|--------|----------|
| S-122.1 | Select the failing project and open Workflow Runs | The failed run appears with its run ID, workflow name, failure status, and completion time. The healthy project's runs are not mixed into the selected project's list. |
| S-122.2 | Open the failed run | The named failing step and its error message are visible, with a link or action to inspect the run's logs. |
| S-122.3 | Follow the run's log action | Studio opens logs filtered to the selected project and run; the unique diagnostic marker and failed-step output are visible. |
| S-122.4 | Open Observability Metrics or service health from the same project context | The unhealthy service/runtime is named with its reported health state and recent error; the project/run context remains identifiable. |
| S-122.5 | Request the same diagnostics when the observability service is unavailable | Studio shows a visible error naming the unavailable diagnostics source and the next command `kb-create doctor --platform-root <platform-root>`; the workflow failure detail remains available. |
