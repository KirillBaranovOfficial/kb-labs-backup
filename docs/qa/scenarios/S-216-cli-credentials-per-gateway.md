## Goal

A user who works with their own platform and with the official KB Labs marketplace stays signed in to both. Each saved credential is used only at the Gateway that issued it, and signing in to one never signs the user out of another.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Two secured Gateways with different origins: the user's platform (A) and a marketplace Gateway (B).
- [ ] A user account on each Gateway.

## Steps

| # | Action | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| S-216.1 | Run `kb auth login --gateway-url <A> --email <email> --password-stdin`, then `kb auth login --gateway-url <B> --email <email> --password-stdin` | Both logins exit 0. The second login adds a session for B and leaves A's session unchanged; the user's credential store holds one entry per Gateway origin. |
| S-216.2 | Run `kb auth status --json` | The ADR-0049 success envelope lists every saved session with its Gateway origin, email, and expiry; no token value appears. |
| S-216.3 | Run a protected command against A, then one against B | Each request carries only the credential issued by its own Gateway origin; no request to B carries A's token, and no refresh is sent to a different origin. |
| S-216.4 | Run `kb auth logout --gateway-url <B>`, then repeat the protected command against A | Logout removes only B's session; the command against A still succeeds. A command against B returns `KB_AUTH_REQUIRED` with a login hint for B's URL. |
| S-216.5 | With no session for B, run a command that targets B | The command exits non-zero with `KB_AUTH_REQUIRED` and a hint naming B's URL; it does not fall back to A's session or to a machine credential issued by another origin. |

This stays planned until the official marketplace Gateway exists. The origin-bound rule in S-203.23 already holds for the single saved session; this case extends it to several saved sessions.
